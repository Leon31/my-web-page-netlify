      <i>Creative Developer in </i>❤️<i>with UX/UI</i>
      <p>
      I love starting projects from scratch, often described as <b>"highly creative"</b> by my co-workers. This means I can quickly turn ideas and designs into functioning code on both front and backend. 
        <br/><br/>
        I perform well in agile teams, trying to learn the most from my team members, so to grow faster.
        <br/><br/>
        Enthusiast about product and interior design, photography, editorial design, and everything that has a nice aesthetic.
